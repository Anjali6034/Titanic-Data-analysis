# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset Analysis 

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics and survival patterns. The goal is to uncover insights using data visualization and statistical techniques.

## 📌 Key Objectives

- Understand the structure and features of the Titanic dataset.
- Analyze survival rates across different passenger groups.
- Visualize relationships between features such as age, class, gender, and fare.
- Handle missing data and perform data cleaning.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## 📁 Project Structure

- `EDA_on_Titanic_Dataset.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full exploratory analysis.

## 📈 Highlights

- Insightful visualizations for gender and class-based survival analysis.
- Handling and imputation of missing values.
- Correlation analysis and data distribution plots.
